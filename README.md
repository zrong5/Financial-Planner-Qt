## Description
I have developed this financial planner for personal use to budget my household finace simply because there are not a lot of easy to use and view financial planners out there. 

The first page is going to be the dashboard of all of your expenses. Initially, the dashboard will be empty along with the pie chart.

2. Select Budget with will navigate you to the budget page
3. Once on Budget page, click +/- button on bottom right hand side
4. Select add category 
5. Enter category name and percentage

1. On Dashboard page, click + icon on bottom 
2. Select expense category and enter amount

### To add accounts:

## Languages:
C++, Qt, Css.
## Later Improvements:

-Have a separate window that pops up that show the place of purchase and amount so the user can keep track of what store they visit most often. And if returns were made, user can delete that expense.

-Implement a report page where user can see their past monthly or yearly reports to track their spendings.
